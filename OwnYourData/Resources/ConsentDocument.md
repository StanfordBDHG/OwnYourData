**Consent for OwnYourData Application**

**Introduction**

Welcome to OwnYourData. To provide you with the best experience and services, we need your consent to access your health records and match them with clinical trials listed in the NCI Clinical Trial Search database.

**Purpose**

The purpose of accessing your health records is to identify suitable clinical trials that may benefit you based on your health data.

**Data Security**

**Encryption**: All data pulled from the EHR via the FHIR API will reside on your mobile device and be encrypted both in flight and at rest. Any data generated and aggregated in the application is stored locally using an Apple Keychain-based encryption. Data sent to the cloud-based LLM is encrypted in flight.

**No Sharing Without Permission**: Only minimal data will be shared with the API, and no data sharing or processes will be performed without your explicit permission. If you agree to participate in a clinical trial, only the necessary information will be shared with the trial organizers.

**Data Storage**

* Your patient data is stored in the Apple Health app.

* Users are currently responsible for providing an OpenAI account for cloud-based services.

**Modeled Consent for Recontact**

We will only contact you if we believe you may be a good fit for a study based on the health data you have provided. You have the right to opt out of these communications at any time by adjusting your settings in the application or by contacting our support team.
