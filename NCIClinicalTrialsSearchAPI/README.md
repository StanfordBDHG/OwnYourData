# Swift5 API client for OpenAPIClient

<p>For information on NCI's efforts to improve how patients and oncologists find information and learn about cancer clinical trials please visit: <br><a href='https://www.cancer.gov/syndication/api' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>https://www.cancer.gov/syndication/api</a></p><h2>Fetching Daily Updates</h2><p>Updates to the API are made daily (the refresh occurs each morning by 7:30 AM ET). The API does not do a <code>diff</code> to track changes, and there is no one field in the underlying database (that the API taps into) which captures when a trial has been modified. The best field to use to see which trials have <em>possibly</em> been changed in the past 24 hours is the <code>record_verification_date</code> field. This field is updated whenever a human auditor verifies a clinical trial record. It is important to note that verification does not necessarily imply that a change was made to the clinical trial record, simply that an auditor took another look at it - but this is inclusive of any instances where the auditor made modifications to the trial.</p><p>As an example, to see which clinical trials have been verified by an auditor since 2016-08-25...       </p><p>Example: <font class=\"example\" color=\"#97D4EA\" style=\"word-wrap: break-word;\">trials?record_verification_date_gte=2016-08-25</font></p><hr><h2>Authorization</h2><p>To use API, an API key is required. <a href=\"/signin\" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Request API key</a></p><hr><h2>Issues</h2><p>Please ask questions or report issues to <a href=\"mailto:ctrp_support@mail.nih.gov\" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>ctrp_support@mail.nih.gov</a>.</p>
